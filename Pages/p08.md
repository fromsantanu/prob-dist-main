# 📝 **Tutorial: Simulation and Applications**

---

## ⭐ **1. What is Simulation in Probability?**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Simulation involves **generating random samples to mimic real-life scenarios** and study their outcomes.

🔹 **Why do we use it?**
✔️ Easy to model complex problems
✔️ Helps understand probability concepts practically
✔️ Useful in **risk analysis and decision making**

---

## 🎯 **2. Using Python for Probability Simulations**

### 🔹 **Example 1: Coin Toss Simulation**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate tossing a fair coin 10 times
outcomes = np.random.choice(['H', 'T'], size=10)
print("Coin toss outcomes:", outcomes)
```

---

### 🔹 **Example 2: Dice Roll Simulation**

```python
# Simulate rolling a dice 20 times
dice = np.random.randint(1, 7, 20)
print("Dice rolls:", dice)
```

---

### 🔹 **Example 3: Estimating Probability by Simulation**

**Problem:** What is the probability of getting **at least one 6** in **10 rolls** of a dice?

```python
trials = 10000
success = 0

for i in range(trials):
    rolls = np.random.randint(1, 7, 10)
    if 6 in rolls:
        success += 1

probability = success / trials
print("Estimated probability of at least one 6 in 10 rolls:", probability)
```

✅ **Output:** Approximately **0.838** (theoretical value: $1-(5/6)^{10}$)

---

## ⭐ **3. Monte Carlo Simulation (Basic Introduction)**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Monte Carlo simulation is a **technique that uses repeated random sampling** to estimate numerical results.

---

### 🎯 **Where is it used?**

✔️ Finance (e.g. portfolio risk)
✔️ Engineering (e.g. reliability analysis)
✔️ Operations research (e.g. queuing problems)

---

### 🔢 **Basic Steps in Monte Carlo Simulation**

1. Define a **model**.
2. Generate **random inputs**.
3. Compute **outputs** for each set of inputs.
4. Repeat many times to **estimate probabilities, means, or risks**.

---

### 🔹 **Example: Estimating Value of π**

```python
import random

inside_circle = 0
trials = 100000

for i in range(trials):
    x = random.random()
    y = random.random()
    if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:
        inside_circle += 1

pi_estimate = (inside_circle / trials) * 4
print("Estimated value of pi:", pi_estimate)
```

✅ **Explanation:** Points are generated in a square; proportion within circle estimates π.

---

## ⭐ **4. Applications of Probability in Risk Analysis and Decision Making**

🔹 **i. Finance**

* **Portfolio risk analysis:** Simulate market returns to estimate risk of loss.

---

🔹 **ii. Operations Management**

* **Inventory planning:** Simulate demand to decide order quantities.

---

🔹 **iii. Project Management**

* **Project completion time:** Simulate task durations to estimate completion probability within deadlines.

---

🔹 **iv. Insurance**

* **Premium calculation:** Simulate claim probabilities and amounts to set profitable premiums.

---

### 🎯 **Example: Decision Making Using Simulation**

**Problem:** A company wants to decide whether to launch a new product.

* Cost = \$10,000
* Success probability = 0.4
* Profit if successful = \$50,000
* Loss if fails = -\$10,000

✅ **Expected Profit Calculation:**

$$
E[Profit] = 0.4 \times 50000 + 0.6 \times (-10000) = 20000 - 6000 = 14000
$$

### 💡 **Interpretation:**

On average, the project yields **\$14,000 profit** → launching is profitable.

---

## 💻 **Python Example: Simulation for Decision**

```python
trials = 10000
profits = []

for i in range(trials):
    outcome = np.random.choice(['Success', 'Fail'], p=[0.4, 0.6])
    if outcome == 'Success':
        profits.append(50000 - 10000)  # profit - cost
    else:
        profits.append(-10000)  # loss = cost only

expected_profit = np.mean(profits)
print("Estimated expected profit:", expected_profit)
```

✅ **Output:** Close to theoretical **\$14,000**.

## 🔬 **5. Practice Questions**

1. What is Monte Carlo simulation in simple words?
2. Simulate tossing two coins 1000 times. What is the estimated probability of getting two heads?
3. Why are simulations useful in risk analysis?

---

### ✅ **6. Quick Answers**

1. Using random sampling repeatedly to estimate results.
2. Expected probability = 0.25 (simulate to verify).
3. Helps model **uncertain outcomes** and estimate risks or profits.
