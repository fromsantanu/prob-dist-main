# 📝 **Tutorial: Discrete Probability Distributions**

---

## ⭐ **1. Bernoulli Distribution**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
A **Bernoulli distribution** models a single trial with **two outcomes**: Success (1) or Failure (0).

🔢 **Examples:**

* Tossing a coin: Head (1), Tail (0)
* Passing an exam: Pass (1), Fail (0)

🔢 **Formula (PMF):**

$$
P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}
$$

where

* $x=0,1$
* $p$ = probability of success

---

### 💡 **Mean and Variance**

* **Mean = p**
* **Variance = p(1-p)**

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
# Bernoulli distribution simulation

import numpy as np

p = 0.6
sample = np.random.binomial(1, p, 10)
print("Bernoulli samples (10 trials):", sample)
```

---

## ⭐ **2. Binomial Distribution**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Models **number of successes** in **n independent Bernoulli trials**.

🔢 **Examples:**

* Number of heads in 10 coin tosses
* Number of defective items in a batch

🔢 **Formula (PMF):**

$$
P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

where

* $n$ = number of trials
* $k$ = number of successes
* $p$ = probability of success

---

### 💡 **Mean and Variance**

* **Mean = np**
* **Variance = np(1-p)**

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
# Binomial distribution simulation

n = 10
p = 0.5
sample = np.random.binomial(n, p, 10)
print("Binomial samples (10 samples of 10 trials):", sample)
```

---

## ⭐ **3. Poisson Distribution**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Models **number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space** when events occur **independently at a constant rate**.

🔢 **Examples:**

* Number of calls at a call center per hour
* Number of decay events per minute in radioactive material

🔢 **Formula (PMF):**

$$
P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where

* $\lambda$ = average rate (mean number of events)
* $k$ = number of events

---

### 💡 **Mean and Variance**

* **Mean = λ**
* **Variance = λ**

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
# Poisson distribution simulation

lam = 3
sample = np.random.poisson(lam, 10)
print("Poisson samples (10 samples with λ=3):", sample)
```

---

## ⭐ **4. Geometric Distribution**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Models the **number of trials needed to get the first success**.

🔢 **Examples:**

* Number of tosses needed to get first head
* Number of calls until first sale

🔢 **Formula (PMF):**

$$
P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p
$$

where

* $p$ = probability of success
* $k$ = trial number of first success

---

### 💡 **Mean and Variance**

* **Mean = 1/p**
* **Variance = (1-p)/p²**

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
# Geometric distribution simulation

p = 0.3
sample = np.random.geometric(p, 10)
print("Geometric samples (trials to first success):", sample)
```

---

## ⭐ **5. Negative Binomial Distribution**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Models the **number of trials needed to achieve r successes**.

🔢 **Examples:**

* Number of tosses needed to get 3 heads

🔢 **Formula (PMF):**

$$
P(X=k) = \binom{k-1}{r-1} p^r (1-p)^{k-r}
$$

where

* $p$ = probability of success
* $r$ = number of successes
* $k$ = trial number of r-th success

---

### 💡 **Mean and Variance**

* **Mean = r/p**
* **Variance = r(1-p)/p²**

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
# Negative binomial distribution simulation

r = 3
p = 0.5
sample = np.random.negative_binomial(r, p, 10)
print("Negative Binomial samples (trials for 3 successes):", sample)
```

---

## ⭐ **6. Hypergeometric Distribution**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Models the **number of successes in a sample drawn without replacement** from a finite population.

🔢 **Examples:**

* Drawing 5 cards from a deck: number of hearts drawn

🔢 **Formula (PMF):**

$$
P(X=k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}
$$

where

* $N$ = total population
* $K$ = total successes in population
* $n$ = sample size
* $k$ = successes in sample

---

### 💡 **Mean and Variance**

* **Mean = n(K/N)**
* **Variance = n(K/N)(1-K/N)(N-n)/(N-1)**

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
# Hypergeometric distribution simulation

N = 52  # total cards
K = 13  # hearts
n = 5   # cards drawn

sample = np.random.hypergeometric(K, N-K, n, 10)
print("Hypergeometric samples (hearts in 5 cards):", sample)
```

## 🔬 **7. Practice Questions**

1. What is the mean number of heads in 20 tosses of a fair coin?
2. If λ=4 for a Poisson process, what is the probability of 0 events?
3. For geometric distribution with p=0.2, what is the expected number of trials?
4. In a deck of 52 cards, if you draw 4 cards, what distribution models the number of spades drawn?

---

### ✅ **8. Quick Answers**

1. Mean = 20 \* 0.5 = **10**
2. P(X=0) = e^-4 = **0.0183**
3. Expected trials = 1 / 0.2 = **5**
4. **Hypergeometric distribution**
