# 📝 **Tutorial: Experiments, Sample Space, and Events**

### ⭐ **1. What is an Experiment?**

**Definition (Simple Words):**
An **experiment** is any **action or process that gives a result**.

🔹 **Examples:**

* Tossing a coin
* Rolling a dice
* Drawing a card from a deck

---

### 📌 **2. What is an Outcome?**

✅ **Outcome:** The **result of an experiment**.

**Examples:**

* Tossing a coin → Head or Tail
* Rolling a dice → 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6

---

### 🔢 **3. What is Sample Space?**

✅ **Sample Space (S):**
The **set of all possible outcomes** of an experiment.

🔹 **Examples:**

* Tossing a coin once

  $$
  S = \{H, T\}
  $$

* Rolling a dice once

  $$
  S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
  $$

* Tossing two coins

  $$
  S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}
  $$

---

### 🎯 **4. What is an Event?**

✅ **Event:**
A **subset of the sample space**, i.e., one or more outcomes that we are interested in.

🔹 **Examples:**

* Rolling a dice → Event: Getting an even number → {2, 4, 6}
* Tossing two coins → Event: Getting exactly one head → {HT, TH}

### 💡 **5. Types of Events**

| Type                 | Meaning               | Example                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Event**     | Single outcome        | Rolling a 5                            |
| **Compound Event**   | More than one outcome | Rolling an even number                 |
| **Impossible Event** | Probability = 0       | Rolling a 7 on a dice                  |
| **Certain Event**    | Probability = 1       | Getting a number between 1-6 on a dice |

---

### 🔍 **6. Visual Example**

🎲 **Experiment:** Rolling a dice
✅ **Sample Space:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
🎯 **Event A:** Getting a number less than 4 → {1, 2, 3}

---

### 💻 **7. Python Practice Example**

```python
# Define sample space and event for rolling a dice

sample_space = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Define event: getting number less than 4
event = [num for num in sample_space if num < 4]

print("Sample Space:", sample_space)
print("Event (number less than 4):", event)
```

✅ **Output:**

```
Sample Space: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Event (number less than 4): [1, 2, 3]
```

### 🔬 **8. Practice Questions**

1. Define the sample space when **drawing a card from a deck of 52 cards**.
2. What is the event of **drawing a heart card**?
3. What is the sample space for tossing **three coins**?

---

### ✅ **9. Quick Answers**

1. All 52 cards.
2. All 13 heart cards in the deck.
3. {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

---

### 🎯 **Summary**

* **Experiment:** Action giving results
* **Outcome:** Result of experiment
* **Sample Space:** All possible outcomes
* **Event:** The outcomes we are interested in
