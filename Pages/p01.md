# 📝 **Tutorial: Experiments, Sample Space, and Events**

### ⭐ **1. What is an Experiment?**

**Definition (Simple Words):**
An **experiment** is any **action or process that gives a result**.

🔹 **Examples:**

* Tossing a coin
* Rolling a dice
* Drawing a card from a deck

---

### 📌 **2. What is an Outcome?**

✅ **Outcome:** The **result of an experiment**.

**Examples:**

* Tossing a coin → Head or Tail
* Rolling a dice → 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6

---

### 🔢 **3. What is Sample Space?**

✅ **Sample Space (S):**
The **set of all possible outcomes** of an experiment.

🔹 **Examples:**

* Tossing a coin once

  $$
  S = \{H, T\}
  $$

* Rolling a dice once

  $$
  S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
  $$

* Tossing two coins

  $$
  S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}
  $$

---

### 🎯 **4. What is an Event?**

✅ **Event:**
A **subset of the sample space**, i.e., one or more outcomes that we are interested in.

🔹 **Examples:**

* Rolling a dice → Event: Getting an even number → {2, 4, 6}
* Tossing two coins → Event: Getting exactly one head → {HT, TH}

---

### 💡 **5. Types of Events**

| Type                 | Meaning               | Example                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Event**     | Single outcome        | Rolling a 5                            |
| **Compound Event**   | More than one outcome | Rolling an even number                 |
| **Impossible Event** | Probability = 0       | Rolling a 7 on a dice                  |
| **Certain Event**    | Probability = 1       | Getting a number between 1-6 on a dice |

---

### 🔍 **6. Visual Example**

🎲 **Experiment:** Rolling a dice
✅ **Sample Space:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
🎯 **Event A:** Getting a number less than 4 → {1, 2, 3}

---

### 💻 **7. Python Practice Example**

```python
# Define sample space and event for rolling a dice

sample_space = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Define event: getting number less than 4
event = [num for num in sample_space if num < 4]

print("Sample Space:", sample_space)
print("Event (number less than 4):", event)
```

✅ **Output:**

```
Sample Space: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Event (number less than 4): [1, 2, 3]
```

### ✅ **9. Quick Answers**

1. All 52 cards.
2. All 13 heart cards in the deck.
3. {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

### 🎯 **Summary**

* **Experiment:** Action giving results
* **Outcome:** Result of experiment
* **Sample Space:** All possible outcomes
* **Event:** The outcomes we are interested in

# 📝 **Tutorial: Conditional Probability and Bayes’ Theorem**

### ⭐ **1. What is Conditional Probability?**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Conditional Probability is the \*\*probability of an event happening, **given that another event has already happened**.

🔹 **Notation:**

$$
P(A|B)
$$

(read as "Probability of A **given** B")

---

### 🎯 **2. Simple Example**

👤 **Example:**
In a class:

* 10 students are boys
* 5 students are girls
* 3 girls wear glasses

**Question:** If a student is a girl, what is the probability that she wears glasses?

✅ **Solution:**

* Total girls = 5
* Girls with glasses = 3

$$
P(\text{glasses}|\text{girl}) = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

---

### 🔢 **3. Formula for Conditional Probability**

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

🔹 **Where:**

* $P(A \cap B)$ = Probability of both A and B happening
* $P(B)$ = Probability of B happening

---

### 📌 **4. Independence of Events**

✅ **Independent Events:**
Two events are **independent** if **one happening does not affect the other**.

🔹 **Mathematically:**

$$
P(A|B) = P(A)
$$

**Example:** Tossing two coins. First coin being head does not affect the second.

---

### 🔍 **5. Dependent Events**

✅ **Dependent Events:**
When **one event affects the probability of another**.

**Example:** Drawing two cards from a deck **without replacement**.

---

### ⭐ **6. What is Bayes’ Theorem?**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
Bayes' theorem allows us to **reverse conditional probabilities**.

🔹 **Formula:**

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

🔹 **Where:**

* $P(A|B)$ = Probability of A given B (posterior)
* $P(B|A)$ = Probability of B given A (likelihood)
* $P(A)$ = Probability of A (prior)
* $P(B)$ = Probability of B (evidence)

---

### 🎯 **7. Simple Example of Bayes’ Theorem**

👤 **Example:**

* 1% people have a disease.
* Test is 99% accurate (both true positive and true negative).

**Question:** If a person tests positive, what is the probability they actually have the disease?

---

✅ **Solution Outline (Intuitive):**

* **Out of 10000 people:**

  * 100 (1%) have disease → 99 test positive (true positive)
  * 9900 do not have disease → \~99 test positive (false positive)

* **Total positive tests = 99 + 99 = 198**

🔹 Therefore,

$$
P(\text{disease}|\text{positive}) = \frac{99}{198} = 0.5
$$

🔍 **Meaning:** Even if test is 99% accurate, **only 50%** of positive results are true because disease is rare.

---

### 💻 **8. Python Practice Example**

```python
# Example: Bayes Theorem Calculation

# P(Disease) = 0.01
# P(No Disease) = 0.99
# P(Positive | Disease) = 0.99
# P(Positive | No Disease) = 0.01

# Calculate P(Disease | Positive)

P_D = 0.01
P_ND = 0.99
P_Pos_D = 0.99
P_Pos_ND = 0.01

P_Pos = P_Pos_D * P_D + P_Pos_ND * P_ND

P_D_Pos = (P_Pos_D * P_D) / P_Pos

print("Probability of having disease given positive test result:", P_D_Pos)
```

✅ **Output:**
`Probability of having disease given positive test result: 0.5`

---

### 🔬 **9. Practice Questions**

1. If P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.4, and P(A ∩ B) = 0.12, what is P(A|B)?
2. In a company, 70% employees are male, and 60% of males know Python. What is the probability that a randomly chosen employee is a male who knows Python?

---

### ✅ **10. Quick Answers**

1. $\frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3$
2. $0.7 \times 0.6 = 0.42$

---

### 🎯 **Summary**

* **Conditional Probability:** Probability of an event given another has occurred.
* **Bayes’ Theorem:** Reverses conditional probabilities; widely used in diagnostics, spam detection, and AI.
