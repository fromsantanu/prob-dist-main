# 📝 **Tutorial: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem**

---

## ⭐ **1. Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
The **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)** states that as the **number of trials increases**, the **sample mean approaches the true population mean**.

---

### 🎯 **Example**

If you **toss a fair coin** many times:

* In 10 tosses: Heads may come 3 or 7 times.
* In 1000 tosses: Heads will come **close to 500 times (50%)**.

---

### 🔢 **Formulaic Representation**

$$
\bar{X_n} \rightarrow \mu \quad \text{as } n \rightarrow \infty
$$

* $\bar{X_n}$ = sample mean
* $\mu$ = population mean

---

## ⭐ **2. Weak Law vs Strong Law of Large Numbers**

| Type           | Meaning                                                     | Key Difference                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Weak LLN**   | Sample mean **converges in probability** to population mean | Convergence in probability         |
| **Strong LLN** | Sample mean **almost surely converges** to population mean  | Almost sure convergence (stronger) |

---

### 💡 **Interpretation**

✅ Both laws say **sample mean approaches true mean**, but:

* **Weak LLN:** Probability of difference being large goes to 0.
* **Strong LLN:** The sequence of sample means **almost surely converges** to the true mean.

---

### 🎯 **Simple Analogy**

Imagine walking towards a wall:

* **Weak LLN:** You’ll get very close.
* **Strong LLN:** You will eventually **touch it**.

---

## ⭐ **3. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**

✅ **Definition (Simple Words):**
The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that **the distribution of sample means becomes approximately normal** as **sample size increases**, **regardless of the original population distribution**.

---

### 🔢 **Formulaic Representation**

If X₁, X₂,…Xₙ are i.i.d. with mean μ and variance σ²,

$$
\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})
$$

when **n is large**.

---

### 🎯 **Example**

If individual heights follow **any distribution**, the **mean height of large samples** will follow a **normal distribution**.

---

### 💡 **Key Points**

* Works for **n ≥ 30** in most cases.
* Allows **use of normal distribution in inferential statistics**.

---

## ⭐ **4. Applications of CLT**

✔️ **Confidence Intervals:** Estimating population parameters.
✔️ **Hypothesis Testing:** Using z-tests or t-tests.
✔️ **Sampling:** Predicting distribution of sample means.
✔️ **Quality Control:** Monitoring process averages.

---

## ⭐ **5. Practical Example of CLT in Data Analysis**

### 🔹 **Scenario:**

You want to estimate the **average daily sales** of a supermarket.

✅ **Steps:**

1. Take **many random samples** (e.g. 50 days each).
2. Calculate the **mean sales of each sample**.
3. Plot a histogram of these means.

🔹 **Observation:**
The histogram will show a **bell-shaped (normal) distribution**, even if actual daily sales data is skewed.

---

### 💻 **Python Example**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Original population: exponential (skewed)
population = np.random.exponential(scale=100, size=100000)

sample_means = []
for i in range(1000):
    sample = np.random.choice(population, size=50)
    sample_means.append(np.mean(sample))

plt.hist(sample_means, bins=30, edgecolor='k')
plt.title("Distribution of Sample Means (CLT)")
plt.xlabel("Sample Mean")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

✅ **Output:** Shows **normal distribution** of sample means.

## 🔬 **6. Practice Questions**

1. What does the Law of Large Numbers state in simple words?
2. How does Weak LLN differ from Strong LLN?
3. Explain CLT with a real-life example.
4. Why is CLT important in inferential statistics?

---

### ✅ **7. Quick Answers**

1. Sample mean approaches population mean as sample size increases.
2. Weak: convergence in probability; Strong: almost sure convergence.
3. Heights in a population: sample means form a normal distribution as sample size increases.
4. It allows **using normal-based methods regardless of population distribution**.
